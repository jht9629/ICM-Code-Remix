-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Recap, Explore and Experiment - Animation: Variables

Let's recap, explore, and experiment with the concepts introduced in this session.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2.0 Increment by one

Ways to add one to a variable `x`:
* `x = x + 1;` 
* `x += 1;` 
* `x++;`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Ex 2.1 mouseX and mouseY

[sketch - p5js Code! - 2.1 - mouseX,mouseY](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/IeblvUQrf) Open these sketch in a separate window so that you can play it and read this page at the same time.

This sketch from the video uses the p5js variables `mouseX` and  `mouseY` to draw circles on the canvas. Code in the function `mousePressed` causes the canvas to be black whenever mouse is pressed anywhere on the page. A circle is drawn when the mouse moves over the canvas.

```
function draw() {
  noStroke();
  fill(255, 50);
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 24);
}

function mousePressed() {
  background(0);
}
```

Let's re-mix this sketch and spice it up a little using basic arithmatic.

### mouseDragged

[sketch - 2.1.2 mouseX,mouseY](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/KaijsTyVc)

To have drawing happen only when the mouse button is pressed and moved, we define [function mouseDragged](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseDragged).

```
function mouseDragged() {
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 24);
}
```

### arithmetic on mouseX

[sketch - 2.1.2 mouseX,mouseY arith](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/pmA0d9Uqt) Two circles are drawn when the mouse moves in this sketch.

We can draw multiple shapes based on the mouse location using some basic arithmetic. 

```
function mouseDragged() {
  circle(mouseX-25, mouseY, 24);
  circle(mouseX+25, mouseY, 24);
}
```

### > Try

- adding other shapes to draw when the mouse is dragged.

### > Try

- as one shape is drawn, another shape is drawn to mirror it

[sketch - 2.1.2 mouseX mirror](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/C2bgbELqa)

### > Try

- Add ui elements to control color and give feedback about mouse location and canvas color. Borrow code from previous session.

[sketch - 2.1.4 mouseX mirror ui](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/I8zejgYIX)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Ex 2.2 Variables circleX

[sketch - make your own variable](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/xPXNdPy17)  

In this sketch the variable circleX is used to control the location of the circle. The circle will move to the right indefinitely. We'll use the math operator remainder to have the circle jump back to the left after it has passed the right edge of the canvas.

The remainder operator will give the remainder when a number (x) is divided by another (n).
The net effect is that one value can be use to limit another value.
Some examples:
```
1 % 3 // result is 1, 1 divided by 3 is 0, remainder 1
4 % 3 // result is 1, 4 divided by 3 is 1, remainder 1
5 % 3 // result is 2, 5 divided by 3 is 1, remainder 2
x % n // result is always between 0 and n-1
```

[sketch - 2.2.1 circleX width](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/CwYDz_4N2)   

- variable circleX is incremented and limited to the range 0 ... width
- when the value circleX + 1 equals width the result will be clipped to 0

```
  circleX = (circleX + 1) % width;
```

### > Try

- add another shape that moves top to bottom

[sketch - 2.2.1 shape1 shape2 ](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/cuaGTyRYU)   

### > Try

- re-mix [sketch - growing circle](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/ehbMJ-otC) use the remainder operator to limit the circle growth

[sketch - 2.2.3 circleR growing](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/2ZGRl9x1p)  

### > Try

- remix [sketch - 2.2.1 variable...](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/CwYDz_4N2) with buttons to change the diameter of the circle

[sketch -  2.2.4 circleX width ui](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/UhNMB6GQO)   

### > Try

- disable background drawing and play with alpha colors

- add buttons to change colors

- add button for random color

[sketch - sketch - 2.2.5 variable circleX rgb](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/mDleb9mKk)   

## Ex 2.3 Incrementing for animation

These examples use this coding pattern to create animation: A variable, circleX, is updated by incrementing its value. There is an illusion of motion as the shape is drawn one pixel to the right each time the function 'draw' is called.

```
  circleX = (circleX + 1) % width;
```

We could increase the apparent speed of this animation by adding a value greater than 1:

```
  circleX = (circleX + 2) % width;
```

By increasing the value of the increment, the speed of the shape across the canvas increases.

### > Try

- create a new variable that controls the speed of the animation

[sketch - 2.3.1 shape1 speed](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/WL3YIp05x)

- create a second shape that animates across the screen at a different speed

[sketch - 2.3.2 shape1 shape2 speed](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/IuKS1TIjB)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Ex 2.4 [function random()](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random)

The random function is a versatile function that can add variety to our sketches.
We've seen it used to produce a random number with in a range:
```
// x will be a random number between width/2 and width
// ie. the right half of the canvas
let x = random(width/2,width);
```
We can also get a less random selection by using an `array` of values. An array is a series of values enclosed in square brackets. In future session we'll get deeper into creating and modifing arrays. For now we'll use them as a source for values.

```
// x will be one of 10,20,100,200
let x = random([10,20,100,200]);
// col will be one of 'red', 'green' or 'yellow'
let col = random(['red','green','yellow']);
```

The array notation can also be used to specify colors with alpha values:
```
let cRed = [255,0,0,10]; // red,green,blue,alpha
let cGreen = [0,255,0,10];
let cYellow = [255,255,0,10];
// pick a random color value
let col = random([cRed,cGreen,cYellow]);
```

### > Try

- remix one of the circleX sketches to change the shape to a random color when the canvas is clicked.

[sketch - 2.4.1 random shape1](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/N2VJYjIWg)

### > Try

- use alpha color and remove `background` function call from `draw` function so drawings build up.

[sketch - 2.4.2 shape1 alpha](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/UDMyivHEQ)

### > Try

- use the frameRate function to slow down the animation
- add variables to quickly experiment with alpha, change in shape1x variable, and size of circle.

[sketch - 2.4.3 shape1 alpha slow](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/iNY8JDhzH)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Ex 2.5 patterns

[sketch - 2.5 setup pattern draw_shape1](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/OtE1lw_X2)

Open the sketch, make sure the console panel below the sketch is visible,
and play the sketch. You'll see a pattern of gray circles and squares.
The `draw` function is not used. All drawing is done in the `setup` function so only static or non-animated pattern is created.

The canvas should look like this:  
![](../assets/2.5-setup-pattern.png)

and you should see the console messages. If you don't see all of these lines, pull the top edge of the console panel up to make it bigger.
```
row 1 
draw_shape1 x=0 y=0 
draw_shape1 x=50 y=0 
draw_shape1 x=100 y=0 
row 2 
draw_shape1 x=0 y=100 
draw_shape1 x=50 y=100 
setup done 
```

What's going on?
In this sketch the function `draw_shape1` draws a a circle atop a square. It is called several times from the `setup` function.

### function `draw_shape1`

The function `draw_shape1` is defined in this sketch. It draws a circle and a rect. The location of the drawing will be relative to the position given to the function. By defining our own function we can easily run (or call) a series of instructions. In this case we only do two simple drawings as an illustration. To make a different static pattern, add or modify the function calls `circle` or  `rect`.

```
// Draw a circle on top of square
function draw_shape1(x, y) {
  console.log('draw_shape1 x=' + x + ' y=' + y)
  circle(x + 0, y + 25, 50)
  rect(x - 25, y + 50, 50, 50);
}
```
### parameter variables
The terms `x` and `y` are called `parameter variables` and they will take on values when the function `draw_shape1` is called. The `console.log` line displays the values of `x` and `y` to help us follow the execution of this code.

The function `draw_shape1` is called several times in the `setup` function:
```
  draw_shape1(0, 0);
  draw_shape1(50, 0);
  ...
```
Each time `draw_shape1` is called it will have new values for `x` and `y.`
In the first call both `x` and `y` will be 0, in the second call `x` will be 50 and `y` will be 0.
In effect the `parameter variables x and y` are place holders for values that will be supplied later.

### > Try

- adding `draw_shape1` calls to fill the canvas with the shape.

- modifying the shapes drawn to get a new pattern.

## Saving the canvas

  - When you are experimenting and discover that you have created an interesting pattern it would be nice to easily save it.
Here's an example of a button to save your canvas as a png file.

[sketch - 2.5 setup pattern draw_shape1 save](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/D34BIqcoE)

### > Try

  - add the save button to one of your animated sketches and save a special moment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Ex 2.6 rotate

These sketches help visualize the behavior of the `rotate` function.

- As the mouse is moved horizontally the line is rotated. Extra lines are drawn to show the X-Y axis.

[sketch - 2.6.1 rotate mouseX](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/5f-4Wm_1H)  

- A variable is used for the angle. Try different values for the angle.

[sketch - 2.6.2 rotate a_angle](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/mq4r5u0v3)  

- UI elements are added to display the value used for the angle.

[sketch - 2.6.3 rotate ui](https://editor.p5js.org/jht1493/sketches/iYtC2NDy7)
